## Go-algo

I implement and maintain the repo with algorithms that I implement from scratch for various projects.
The algorithms in the repo:
- InversionCount.go   - counts number of inversion in an array.
- shortestDistance.go - the algorithm finds the distance between 2 points in a 2D plane with O(n log n)
- BFS - check the wikipediaScaper repo
- Prority Queue - check wikipediaScaper repo
- intervalSelection.go - check the maximum number of interval that can be selected from a set of intervals with no ovelap

#### I'll be updating the repo with more of the algorithms I've implemented for projects.
